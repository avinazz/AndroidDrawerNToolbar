Sample of Material DrawerLayout with Toolbar and Fragment backstack management

This is a sample working project for my own reference covering following features:

- DrawerLayout with Material Design standard
- Toolbar instead of Actionbar
- Toolbar Hamburger to back arrow and viceversa with animation
- Backpress handling of Fragment along with Drawer state.
